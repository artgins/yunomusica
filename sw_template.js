 *          sw_template.js
 *
 *      The service worker, as text. `vite.config.js` reads this file,
 *      substitutes the three placeholders with what the build actually
 *      emitted, and writes the result to dist/sw.js.
 *
 *      It is a template and not a module on purpose: the shell's file
 *      names carry a content hash, so the list of what to precache does
 *      not exist until the bundle does. Nothing imports this file.
 *
 *      What it is for: yunomúsica claimed to be offline and was not.
 *      "Offline" meant "your music never leaves the device", which was
 *      true, and it was read as "it works on a plane", which was false —
 *      without a service worker, opening the app is an ordinary HTTP
 *      request for index.html, and with no network there is no app to
 *      open the local music with.
