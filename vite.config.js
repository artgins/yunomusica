/***********************************************************************
 *          vite.config.js
 *
 *      Build config for yunomúsica.
 *
 *      @yuneta/gobj-js and @yuneta/gobj-ui come from the npm registry as
 *      ordinary versioned dependencies — no path alias, no `file:` link to
 *      a sibling checkout. gobj-ui publishes its `src/` and exports
 *      "./src/*", so the sub-path imports (/src/*.js, /src/*.css) resolve
 *      straight out of node_modules.
 *
 *      The build emits ./dist, which deploy_yunomusica.sh rsyncs to the
 *      static host. No backend: a pure gobj tree with hash routing.
