/***********************************************************************
 *          offline.js
 *
 *      Register the service worker that makes the app open with no
 *      network.
 *
 *      This app reads music from the device and plays it from the
 *      device. The one thing it needed the network for was the thing
 *      nobody thinks of as a download: itself. A manifest makes an app
 *      INSTALLABLE — icon, own window, folder permissions that survive —
 *      and that is all it does. It caches nothing. yunomúsica had the
 *      manifest and no worker, so an installed app with a full music
 *      library still opened to a blank screen on a plane.
 *
 *      Registration is deliberately quiet. It is an improvement to the
 *      launch, not a part of it: nothing here is awaited, and a browser
 *      that refuses (Firefox in private mode, an insecure origin, a user
 *      who blocked storage) simply goes on working the way it did
 *      before, online.
