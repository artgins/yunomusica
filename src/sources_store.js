/***********************************************************************
 *          sources_store.js
 *
 *      The authorised sources: the folders and file sets the user let
 *      yunomúsica read, kept BETWEEN sessions.
 *
 *      Nothing is ever copied. A source holds a reference to what is on
 *      the disk, and the reference is what gets stored:
 *
 *        - kind "dir"   — a FileSystemDirectoryHandle (File System Access
 *          API). It survives in IndexedDB, so the folder is still listed
 *          after a reload; the browser only asks to re-confirm the read
 *          permission, one click, no navigating the tree again. A rescan
 *          picks up files added to the folder since. Chromium only.
 *
 *        - kind "files" — the File objects themselves, which are also
 *          structured-cloneable and so also survive in IndexedDB. This is
 *          what every other engine (and the loose-files picker) gets: the
 *          list is remembered, but it is a SNAPSHOT — files added to the
 *          folder afterwards are not seen, and a file that moved is
 *          reported as missing when it is read.
 *
 *      A folder is always taken WHOLE: the walk recurses into every
 *      subfolder below the one that was chosen.
