/***********************************************************************
 *          install_prompt.js
 *
 *      Can this be installed, and has anyone offered?
 *
 *      Chrome decides on its own whether to show its install banner, and
 *      the heuristic behind that decision is not ours to read: once the
 *      mini-infobar has been dismissed — or once the app has been
 *      installed and removed — the browser goes quiet on this origin for
 *      about three months. The app then LOOKS uninstallable, when in
 *      fact it is only unadvertised, and the way in is buried in the
 *      browser menu. That is exactly what a reinstall runs into.
 *
 *      So the browser's own banner is refused (`preventDefault` in
 *      index.html, before this bundle even loads) and the event it came
 *      with is kept. Asking is then the app's job, at a moment the app
 *      chooses, and calling prompt() on that saved event opens the real
 *      system install dialog — the same one, just not on Chrome's
 *      schedule.
 *
 *      Installing is not cosmetic here: Chrome only offers persistent
 *      folder permissions ("Allow on every visit") to installed apps.
 *      An uninstalled yunomúsica re-asks for every folder on every
 *      launch.
