/***********************************************************************
 *          idb.js
 *
 *      A very small promise wrapper over IndexedDB — the only thing
 *      yunomúsica persists in.
 *
 *      The stores:
 *        - "sources"   the folders and file sets the user authorised.
 *        - "playlists" the lists the user saved.
 *        - "prefs"     small app preferences (theme, locale, "don't show
 *                      the welcome again").
 *
 *      Why IndexedDB and not localStorage: the two things worth keeping
 *      are NOT strings. A FileSystemDirectoryHandle and a File are
 *      structured-cloneable objects, and IndexedDB is the only web store
 *      that keeps them. That is what lets an authorised folder survive a
 *      reload — see sources_store.js.
 *
 *      Every call resolves to a benign value when IndexedDB is missing or
 *      blocked (private mode, an old engine): the app then runs exactly as
 *      it did before, remembering nothing.
