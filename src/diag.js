 *          diag.js
 *
 *      The black box.
 *
 *      The bug this exists for cannot be caught by watching: on a four
 *      hour drive the music stops two or three times and the app comes
 *      back asking for the folders again, which is what a FRESH LAUNCH
 *      looks like. Nobody is holding a debugger at that moment, and the
 *      framework traces are of no use either — they live in memory, and
 *      whatever killed the app took them with it.
 *
 *      So the interesting part of the evidence is written down BEFORE
 *      the death, not after it:
 *
 *        - a heartbeat every fifteen seconds, so the last moment the app
 *          was known to be alive is never more than fifteen seconds from
 *          the moment it died;
 *        - the page-lifecycle events the browser sends on its way to
 *          killing a tab (freeze, pagehide, visibility);
 *        - the JS heap, sampled every five minutes, because "the browser
 *          reclaimed the tab" and "the app leaked until it was reclaimed"
 *          are the same symptom and a different bug;
 *        - and, on the next launch, what the browser admits about it:
 *          `document.wasDiscarded` is Chrome saying "I threw that tab
 *          away", and the navigation type separates a discard from a
 *          renderer crash from the user simply reopening the app.
 *
 *      In localStorage and not IndexedDB, for one reason: localStorage
 *      is SYNCHRONOUS. The records that matter most are the last ones,
 *      written while the tab is being frozen, and an IndexedDB write
 *      started there is a promise nobody lives long enough to keep.
 *
 *      Nothing here is on a hot path: a heartbeat is one small write a
 *      quarter of a minute, and the journal is only appended to when
 *      something actually happens.
