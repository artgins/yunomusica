/***********************************************************************
 *          install_dialog.js
 *
 *      "Do you want to install this?" — asked by the app, once.
 *
 *      The question is worth asking out loud because the answer changes
 *      how the app behaves, not how it looks: Chrome only offers
 *      persistent folder permissions to an installed app, so installing
 *      is the difference between authorising your music folder once and
 *      authorising it at every single launch. That is the reason the
 *      dialog gives, because it is the reason that matters.
 *
 *      Asked once, and only once. "Not now" is remembered for good: the
 *      offer then lives on as a bar on the player screen, which is
 *      there when it is wanted and says nothing when it is not.
